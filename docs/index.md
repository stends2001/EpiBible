# Epidemiology in R: A Hands-on Approach {-}

![](cover.png){style="display:block; margin:auto;"}

Please realize that this reader is work in progress. Some sections are not finished (nor started), work has not yet been cited properly, and I need to make the code a lot more comprehensive in some areas. I will also add many exercises, perhaps in a sort of supplementary reader, and I need to remove some chunks' output (for example, sometimes when loading a package I have a big warning that some function names are being overwritten) that I need to get rid off still.
