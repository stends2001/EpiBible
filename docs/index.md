# Preface






Hi, and welcome! This digital book is meant to serve as a big piece of reference material, covering everything someone with a basic understanding of epidemiology should know. We will be covering some fundamental epidemiology itself, and we will also integrate this fundamental knowledge into learning how to use R for collecting, processing, visualizing and analyzing the most important thing in epidemiology; data. The idea behind this material is not to make an R-wizard out of you. The goal is to get you familiar with R, and with other tools and sources, so that you can develop your own toolkit by yourself, after finishing this document! You will get familiar with some basic computations in R, with some actual mathematical modelling, and with Github and other programming - words that any epidemiologist should be familiar with.
