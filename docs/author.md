# About the Author {-}

As a graduate from a bachelor's degree in Nanobiology (joint degree of the Techinical University in Delft and ERasmus Medical School, the Netherlands) and the MSc. Erasmus Mundus Joint Degree in Infectious Diseases and One Health, I have a solid background in molecular biology, infection biology, public health, epidemiology and data analytics. The fields specifically, I am now integrating on a daily basis during my PhD (Robert Koch Institut, Berlin) in artificial intelligence in public health. On a daily basis I look at the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases, and try to model dynamics and occurances of these diseases.

During my studies, I have seen that people understand more and more the necessity of learning different skills from different fields, to become a more "well - rounded" scientist. While advocating for this, I have also experienced the hesitancy of both students and specialists to take up new skills of the digital and the mathematical area. Especially in the information age that we live in, I find it inexcplicable that students graduating from degrees in public health have practically no experience with working with data.
